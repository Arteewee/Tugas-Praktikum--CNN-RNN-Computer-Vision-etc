# Tugas-Praktikum--CNN-RNN-Computer-Vision-etc
This project was created when I take a practicum on campus   
There are two files the first is when I take the practicum (Image Prediction)   
And the second file is when I take the practicum exam (RNN folder)

## Image Prediction
This prediction is about how to predict the depixelated image

### Requirment
* Keras
* Tenserflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Google.colab
* Python

### Dataset
for the dataset we use the cifar10 dataset which has been prepared by the keras module

### Output
![result cifar 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48760006/137675471-3af6ce37-47ae-4d39-b228-65246c7d222d.jpg)

## RNN google stock price prediction
This prediction is about how to predict google stock price

### Requirment
* Pandas
* Keras
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Google.colab
* Python

### Dataset
for the dataset we use google_stock_price.csv and google_stock_price_train.csv that i uploaded in the RNN folder

### Output
